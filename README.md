# Classic Offensive

Classic Offensive is community remake of Counter-Strike based on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Re-balanced and revitalized, Classic Offensive is an homage to the original vision of the game that started it all.

# Exiled from Steamworks

The project has been retired from Steam after letting us know the release was possible. No explanations were given and no questions were answered.

Following this issue, we've decided to take the route many other mods for unsupported games by their SDK did: releasing outside of Steam.
