# Classic Offensive

Relive the essence of Counter-Strike with Classic Offensive. We take you back to the golden age of fragging! Fluid gunplay, exaggerated physics and sharp movement with the classic aesthetics of 1.6, built on top of CS:GO!

# Exiled from Steamworks

The project has been retired from Steam after letting us know the release was possible. No explanations were given and no questions are answered. Following this issue, we've decided to release outside of Steam, similarly to how we and others have released mods for unsupported games by their SDK in the past.
